In this project we will learn about the Transformer model as well as build a translation model from English to Vietnamese. This will help us learn more about the basic large language model and get ready for other projects.

## üìë Requirements

- **Python Jupyter notebook** - [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/jupyter)

- **Pytorch with CUDA** - [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)

- **Underthesea** - [Underthesea](https://pypi.org/project/underthesea/)

- **Some python libraries** - [requirement](./requirements.txt)

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or we can use [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/) or [kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/) (Pytorch with CUDA, some libraries are available!) 

## üíæ Transformer Understanding

![Transformer Architecture](./Transformer_Understanding/img/transformerarchitect.png)

The Transformer model is a deep learning architecture introduced in the paper "[Attention is All You Need](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf)"** by Vaswani et al. (2017). It has revolutionized natural language processing and other domains by addressing sequential and hierarchical data using attention mechanisms instead of recurrent or convolutional layers.

## üìù Building & Training Translating Model with Transformer Architecture

Check [MyTransformer.py](./MyTransformer.py) and [BuildingTransformerModel.ipynb](./BuildingTransformerModel.ipynb) for understanding the simple ways to build a Transformer model for translating!

Dataset for train: ncduy. (n.d.). mt-en-vi. Hugging Face. Retrieved June 14, 2024, from https://huggingface.co/datasets/ncduy/mt-en-vi

The dataset has more 2 millions rows but only 200.000 rows were taken to train (the limitation of CUDA memory)
